# Morphological Operations on Facial Images

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various morphological operations applied to facial images. It is part of a comprehensive Machine Learning project collection, showcasing practical applications of image processing techniques.

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Primary Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Environments**: 
  - Google Colab
  - Anaconda IDE

## Implemented Operations

1. Opening
2. Closing
3. Morphological Smoothing
4. Morphological Gradient

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow
```

For Google Colab users, ensure you have the following installed:

```python
!pip install opencv-python-headless
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/morphological-operations-facial-images.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd morphological-operations-facial-images
   ```

3. Update the `image_path` variable in the script to point to your facial image file.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python morphological_operations.py
   ```

For Google Colab users, upload the notebook to your Colab environment and follow the in-notebook instructions.

## Sample Output

The script generates a 2x2 grid of subplots, each displaying the result of a different morphological operation:

1. Opening
2. Closing
3. Morphological Smoothing
4. Morphological Gradient
